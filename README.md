### Helldivers TTRPG

Helldivers TTRPG was created to experiment with Typst templates, 
using Typst to create a tabletop RPG based on the Helldivers 2 video game by Arrowhead Studio

### Factory Game
<p>
The main goal with factory game was to learn how the godot game engine works, and to create a small game-like app that where buildings could be placed on a tilegrid.
It currently features two buildings that can be placed and removed from the map, and syncronized animated sprites.
